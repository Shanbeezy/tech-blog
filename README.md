## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend lots of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some time reading and writing about different technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. To help with that, I created a tech Blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well.

## Authors and Acknowledgement

The blog posts data that I found interesting and used, came from https://lokalise.com/blog/top-developer-and-software-engineering-blogs-to-read/. They have multiple blog sites that gave helpful information on all things coding related. If any of the blog sites sound interesting to you, you should check them out!
